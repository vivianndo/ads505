## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze hotel reservations with a focus on developing a classification model for reservation cancellations. The output of this analysis will be used by the marketing and customer relations departments to aid in customer retention and overall fulfillment rates. The goal is to optimize revenue and improve customer relations by proactively identifying and managing reservations with likelihood of cancellation. 

## Background
The hotel industry operates in a dynamic and highly competitive environment, where revenue and room occupancy rates play a crucial role in profitability. Unpredictable cancellations can significantly impact operational efficiency as management is unable to determine occupancy rates. As a result, staffing and material needs may also be affected. 

## Current Situation
The hotel is experiencing high rates of reservation cancellations. From 2017 to 2018, the hotel cancellation rate increased by 21.9% (14.8% and 36.7% respectively) with an average of 33%. For 2018, this equated to $4,021,740 in potential lost revenue.

## Conclusion
Cancellation prevention programs can be developed and deployed with the marketing department and customer relations based on the results from exploring the data. We will be able to target customers with a high likelihood of cancellation to offer them incentives for their hotel stay, and build rapport with personalized phone calls or emails. Increasing marketing efforts and communication with this group of people can reduce the chances of losing profit to cancellation. In the next fiscal year, we can reduce the 33% cancellation rate based on the results from this project, and turn some of the 4 million loss into profit.
